# About me

**W.A.Haworth/Gopnik-Welljokes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ person.

## Brief

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a graph plotter for CSV files in Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with matplotlib. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Coming Soon!]
- âš¡ Fun fact: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

## Languages
